 @abstract Text Field
 @discussion 
 The text field is a view used for text input.
 It conforms to UITextInput (and UIKeyInput) protocols and also NSCoding
 
 Accessing the 'text' property will return only the current editing string, if any. In order to set the tokens
 the property 'representedObjects' should be used instead.
